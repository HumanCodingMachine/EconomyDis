You can set the token and prefix of your bot in the .env file (PS: ONLY CHANGE THE TOKEN DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT FILE!).
In the src folder is also located a file called constants.js, in that file you can change the prefix and add in the necessary information the bot needs to run.

If you don't have a bot token yet, head over to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create an application.

First make sure you have installed the Node.js runtime from the internet.

To host the bot:
1. Run "npm install" in the command prompt.
2. Run "node index.js".

Self-hosting:
Any modern hardware should work 100% fine, but that requires you to keep your PC working 24/7 if you want great uptime.

Free hosting:
Unfortunately there is no reliable free hosting service I can recommend.

That should be it! Enjoy and thanks for ordering my gig!
